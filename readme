Modern Calculator
A sleek, multi-mode calculator with a cyberpunk-inspired design, featuring simple and scientific modes, dark/light themes, and a history panel. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, it is responsive and optimized for deployment on GitHub Pages.
Features

Multi-Mode: Starts in simple mode (basic arithmetic) with a toggle to switch to scientific mode (sin, cos, tan, log, etc.).
Dark Mode: Launches in dark theme with pink neon glow, toggleable to light theme with cyan glow.
Unique Design:
Circular buttons with neon glow effects (pink in dark, cyan in light).
Holographic display with cyberpunk gradients.
Staggered button load animation (no slide-up after clicks).


History Panel: Stores calculation history with Clear History and Close buttons.
Minimal Messages: Displays only critical success messages (e.g., "Calculation successful", "Cleared") and error messages (e.g., "Cannot add multiple operators").
Functionality:
Input validation (blocks multiple operators/decimals, invalid scientific functions).
Decimal rounding to 6 places.
Clipboard copy on display click.
Long press DEL (1s) to clear all.
Keyboard support (numbers, operators, Enter, Backspace, etc.).


Responsive: Adapts to mobile (<400px), tablet (<600px), and desktop screens.
